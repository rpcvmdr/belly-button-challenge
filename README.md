Module 14 Homework Challenge - Prepared by Michael Roberts

The index.html file and the app.js file (located in the folder static/js) contain the code to
complete the following requirements of this homework challenge: 

This involves creating an interactive dashboard which catalogs microbes (operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the navels of humans by designing the following:

	A. A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs from individuals selected individually 
 	from the samples.json database
	B. A bubble chart that displays each sample
	C. A metadata "table" of demographic information for the individuals selected to display their OTUS

The interactive dashboard has been deployed to the hosting service GitHub Pages with the URL: https://rpcvmdr.gitghub.io
